# Express Auth Example

## Intro

This is an example of authentication with Node.js and Express.js using **Json Web Tokens** (also called JWT).

For this example I used **MongoDB** (with mongoose as ORM), **Docker** and, of course Express.js.

## Usage

### Running proyect

**Is required you have docker and docker compose installed!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KytnaCode/auth-express-example.git # clone repo
cd auth-express-example # get into project's folder

docker-compose up # start app
```
The app should now be running in port 3000. Remember that the app runs in port specified in the docker-compose.yml file, not the port displayed in the console (by default console displays port 4000).

### Endpoints

To see endpoints go to `/api-docs`
